Libraries Used
--------------
* [Foundation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/components) - Components for core system capabilities, Kotlin extensions and support for
  multidex and automated testing.
  * [AppCompat][1] - Degrade gracefully on older versions of Android.
  * [Android KTX][2] - Write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.
  * [Test][4] - An Android testing framework for unit and runtime UI tests.
  
* [Architecture][10] - A collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and
  maintainable apps. Start with classes for managing your UI component lifecycle and handling data
  persistence.
  * [Data Binding][11] - Declaratively bind observable data to UI elements.
  * [LiveData][13] - Build data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
  * [Dagger][96] - Automate dependency injection in your app & you don't have to write tedious & error-prone boilerplate code.
  * [ViewModel][17] - Store UI-related data that isn't destroyed on app rotations. Easily schedule
     asynchronous tasks for optimal execution.
     
* [UI][30] - Details on why and how to use UI Components in your apps - together or separate
  * [Layout][35] - Lay out widgets using different algorithms.
* Third party
  * [Rx Java][91] for managing background threads with simplified code and reducing needs for callbacks
  * [Retrofit2][92] for client and server intreaction and callback
